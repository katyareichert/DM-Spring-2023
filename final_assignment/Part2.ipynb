    "Using Python and any relevant libraries, you are required to build the best predictive model by tuning models using cross validation on the training dataset with each of the following algorithms discussed in this module: k-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost, and SVM. Out of the models tuned with the above algorithms, select the best model and clearly justify your choice, and evaluate its performances on the test set."
